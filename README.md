# Automated Testing Engine: AI-Powered Test Orchestration for Efficient Defect Detection
A Selenium-driven test orchestration framework for concurrent execution of parameterized behavioral tests with AI-assisted defect prediction.

The Automated Testing Engine is a cutting-edge testing framework designed to revolutionize the way we approach test automation. By leveraging the power of Selenium, machine learning, and concurrent execution, this framework enables teams to detect defects more efficiently and effectively. With its advanced AI-assisted defect prediction capabilities, the Automated Testing Engine reduces the time and effort required to identify and resolve defects, leading to faster time-to-market and improved overall quality.

The primary goal of this project is to provide a scalable, flexible, and easily maintainable testing framework that can be integrated with various CI/CD pipelines. By automating the testing process, teams can focus on developing new features and improvements, while the engine takes care of ensuring the quality and reliability of the application.

The Automated Testing Engine is designed to be highly customizable, allowing teams to tailor it to their specific needs and requirements. With its advanced reporting and analytics capabilities, teams can gain valuable insights into their testing processes, identify areas for improvement, and optimize their testing strategies.

## Key Features

* **Concurrent Test Execution**: Execute multiple tests concurrently, reducing the overall testing time and increasing efficiency.
* **Parameterized Behavioral Tests**: Define tests with parameterized inputs and expected outputs, allowing for more comprehensive testing and reduced test maintenance.
* **AI-Assisted Defect Prediction**: Leverage machine learning algorithms to predict defect-prone areas of the application, enabling proactive defect detection and resolution.
* **Integration with CI/CD Pipelines**: Seamlessly integrate with various CI/CD pipelines, enabling automated testing and continuous quality assurance.
* **Advanced Reporting and Analytics**: Generate detailed reports and analytics on testing performance, defects, and trends, providing valuable insights for improvement.
* **Flexible and Customizable**: Configure and tailor the engine to meet specific testing needs and requirements.

## Technology Stack

* **Selenium**: A widely-used, open-source tool for automating web browsers, enabling robust and reliable testing.
* **TypeScript**: A statically-typed, superset of JavaScript, providing improved code maintainability, scalability, and reliability.
* **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment, enabling fast and efficient execution of tests.
* **Machine Learning Libraries**: Integration with popular machine learning libraries, such as TensorFlow and scikit-learn, for advanced defect prediction and analysis.

## Installation

To install the Automated Testing Engine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ewhu/AutomatedtestingEngine.git`
2. Install Node.js and npm (if not already installed)
3. Install project dependencies: `npm install`
4. Configure environment variables (see Configuration section)
5. Start the engine: `npm start`

## Configuration

Before using the Automated Testing Engine, configure the following environment variables:

* `TEST_DATA_DIR`: Path to the test data directory
* `SELENIUM_BROWSER`: Desired browser for testing (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
* `ML_MODEL_PATH`: Path to the machine learning model file
* `REPORTING_DIR`: Path to the reporting and analytics output directory

## Usage

To execute tests using the Automated Testing Engine, create a test configuration file (e.g., `test.config.json`) with the following format:

{
  tests: [
    {
      name: Test 1,
      parameters: {
        input: example input,
        expectedOutput: example output
      }
    },
    {
      name: Test 2,
      parameters: {
        input: example input 2,
        expectedOutput: example output 2
      }
    }
  ]
}

Then, execute the tests using the following command: `node index.js --config test.config.json`
